# ublock-origin-filters

My uBlock Origin filters to remove the most annoying bits from some websites.

These are my preferences, probably in a messy and random order, and problably I should create filters for another billions of stuff.

If I miss anything or you think I would benefit from something else, open an issue, pull request or send me an email.

## How to use/install

Add the `0-include-all.txt` file to your imports.

Click the extension, then the open the dashboard in the gears (click `More` to see it). Go to `Filter Lists > Import...` and add the following link:
